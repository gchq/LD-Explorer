			<Heading text="The Problem" tag="h2" variant="h3" />
			<P>
				You are interested in analysing data from one or more structured datasets. The data is
				heterogeneous and unpredictable, so agreeing to a single schema to cover all use cases ahead
				of time is unrealistic. Under these conditions, how should you model your data?
			</P>
		</div>
		<div class="ml-4 py-4">
			<Heading text="The Solution" tag="h2" variant="h3" />
			<P>
				One solution is to apply <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data" external
					>Linked Data</Link
				> principles to your data, transforming unrelated structured datasets into flexible, inter-related
				and self-describing graphs. The learning curve associated with these approaches is often steep,
				with resources often being aimed towards the academic/expert end of the learning spectrum. LD
				Explorer aims to provide an easier path for learning, experimentation and exploration.

			<P>
				Powered by the <Link href="https://comunica.dev/" external>Comunica</Link> query engine, LD-Explorer
				provides an interface allowing users to define both local and remote sources in many different
				linked-data formats such as <Link
					htmlClass="break-keep"
					href="https://json-ld.org/"
					external>JSON-LD</Link
				>, <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TriG_(syntax)" external>TriG</Link> and <Link
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)"
					external>Turtle</Link
				>.
			</P>
			<P>
				Various remote interfaces are supported (e.g. SPARQL endpoints, Linked-Data Fragments,
				Static Files or RDFa-decorated web pages). You can also simply paste your data directly into
				the browser.
			</P>
		</ProductFeature>

		<ProductFeature
			title="Explore linked data"
			screenshot="/screenshots/describe-screenshot.png"
			screenshotAlt="Screenshot of data sources functionality"
			align="right"
		>
			<P>
				Once you have set up one or more data sources, you can start exploring the data using
				several built-in queries that take advantage of the self-describing nature of linked data.
			</P>
			<P>
				Use this functionality to get a feel for the kind of data that exists within a your data
				sources or to browse for a particular piece of data that you are interested in.
			</P>
		</ProductFeature>

		<ProductFeature
			title="Find knowledge connections"
			screenshot="/screenshots/graph-screenshot.png"
			screenshotAlt="Screenshot of data sources functionality"
		>
			<P>
				Because queries are federated across all active data sources, LD-explorer can help to
				uncover previously hidden connections between datasets, or to infer and create new ones.
			</P>
			<P>
				Even if two datasets look completely different and are created non-collaboratively by
				seperate authors, linked data principles can be applied to make them compatible - LD
				Explorer enables you to prototype this kind of functionality directly within the browser.
			</P>
		</ProductFeature>

		<ProductFeature
			title="Perform advanced queries"
			screenshot="/screenshots/sparql-screenshot.png"
			screenshotAlt="Screenshot of data sources functionality"
			align="right"
		>
			<P>
				If the built-in queries are not enough and you want to create something a bit more bespoke,
				you can use the built-in SPARQL query editor to write custom query logic. As with everything
				in LD-explorer, these queries will be run across all active data sources.
			</P>
			<P>
				The results of any SPARQL CONSTRUCT Queries can also be persisted to local data sources,
				allowing you to reshape your knowledge and perform complex inference.
